# OcrPost
Post processor for OCR jobs

# Synopsis
After running Optical Character Recognition on old documents, there are often OCR mistakes that need to be corrected. This simple command line tool lets you configure a set of regular exressions and run them on each text-file in a folder. OcrPost then outputs the processed files to a new folder.
